# rolling-dice
A visualization of rolling pairs of dice, created within a histogram.

Part of Chapter 15 from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

This program uses the Plotly library to simulate rolling various numbers of dice, along with different numbers of sides. The results of a number of rolls are then added to histogram that can be viewed for further data analysis.
